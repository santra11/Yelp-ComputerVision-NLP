# YelpNLP

Within the startup "Avis Restau", which connects customers and restaurants, the mission is to enrich the platform with a new collaboration feature. Users can post reviews and photos of their favorite restaurant. This allows the company to better understand the reviews posted by users. The main goal of the project is detect “the subjects of dissatisfaction of the user” and “automatically label the posted photos.”
