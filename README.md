# Yelp-CV-NLP

Within the startup "Avis Restau", which connects customers and restaurants, the mission is to enrich the platform with a new collaboration feature. Users can post reviews and photos of their favorite restaurant. This allows the company to better understand the reviews posted by users. The main goal of the project is to detect “automatically label the posted photos” (Computer Vision) and “the subjects of dissatisfaction of the user” (NLP). 
* We will use SIFT to classify the yelp images.
* Also we will use deep learning (transfer learning) to classify the images.
* For the detection of 'dissatisfaction of the user' we will use TF-IDF and Word2Vec approach.
